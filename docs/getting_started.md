# Getting Started with Javpy

Javpy is a hybrid programming language combining elements of Java and Python. It offers a unique syntax that makes programming both powerful and intuitive.

## Basic Syntax

### Comments
Javpy uses special markers for block comments:

Comments in Javpy are enclosed between `<$>` and `<$!>` markers:

```
<$>
This is a multi-line comment
It can span multiple lines
<$!>
```

Key rules for comments:
- Comments cannot be nested
- Each <$> must have a matching <$!>
- Comments can appear anywhere in the code
