# Javpy-Core
Javpy is a custom programming language that combines elements of Java and Python, providing a unique hybrid syntax and features. This repository contains the core implementation and runtime environment for the Javpy language.

## Getting Started

### Running Javpy Code

1. Create a new file with `.jvp` extension (e.g., `hello.jvp`)

2. Write your Javpy code in the file:

`print <<Hello from Javpy!>>`


3. Run the code using Javpy interpreter:

`python3 javpy_runner.py hello.jvp`
